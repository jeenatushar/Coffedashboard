Coffee is the Top Performer

Coffee contributes the highest sales ($29K) compared to other categories like Tea ($22K), Bakery ($9K), and Drinking Chocolate ($8K).

This shows that coffee is the primary revenue driver for the business.

Positive Sales Trend Over the Month

The sales trend graph indicates gradual growth across February, with spikes around the mid and end of the month.

Suggests effective promotions or increased customer activity during those periods.

Weekday vs Weekend Sales Distribution

Weekday sales ($54K, ~71%) are significantly higher than weekend sales ($22K, ~29%).

This implies that the business relies more on weekday foot traffic, possibly office-goers or regular customers.

Store Location Contribution

Among locations, Hellâ€™s Kitchen and Lower Manhattan contribute strongly, while Astoria is comparatively lower.

Indicates that location demographics heavily influence sales performance.

Overall Decline vs Previous Period

Compared to the previous period, Total Sales fell by 6.8% (-$5.5K), Orders fell by 5.5% (-1k), and Quantity sold dropped by 5.3% (-1.3K).

These categories represent growth opportunities if marketed properly.
